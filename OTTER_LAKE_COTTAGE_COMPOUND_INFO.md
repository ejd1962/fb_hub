## Vehicles

### 1. Jeep
- **Status:** Eric's vehicle, staying at cottage for 6 months
- **Current location:** Gravel driveway
- **Ideal:** Store in main garage for winter (HIGH YELLOW - prevents windshield cracks, brake rust)
- **Fallback:** Can survive winter outside on driveway (has before, but with $$$ consequences)
- **Past issues from outdoor winter storage:**
  - Windshield crack → full replacement required
  - Brake rust → grinding, tugging → full brake job on all 4 wheels

### 2. Ford Escape
- **Status:** Eric's transport vehicle for trip to Ottawa/Boston/Europe/Asia
- **Current issues:**
  - Rear window: Broken hinges, 1" gap (RED task - MUST fix before O-time)

- **Key plan:** Give one key to storage location, hide second key on vehicle (under wheel well) for May 2026 retrieval
- **Drive distance:** Otter Lake → Ottawa = 90 minutes (80 minutes return from Stittsville)

### 3. Pontiac Torrent
- **Status:** Scrap vehicle at Garage 613 junk lot
- **Issue:** Missing vehicle registration paper (needed for recycling)
- **Plan:** Search kitchen table papers OR get replacement Monday morning at Stittsville vehicle licensing office

- **Manager:** Mohammed at Garage 613 (has keys)

### 4. Blue VW
- **Status:** Scrap on driveway near edge
- **Battery:** Already salvaged for Ford Escape
