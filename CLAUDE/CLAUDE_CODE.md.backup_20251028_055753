# Claude Code (CC) Specific Guidelines
====================================================================


Last Updated: 2025-10-27 11:59:22 pm -- by Eric (manually) 

This file contains preferences specific to **Claude Code (CC)** interactions.

**IMPORTANT**: Always read `CLAUDE_COMMON.md` first - it contains shared guidelines for all Claude interaction modes. This file only covers Claude Code specific preferences.

Current Tools in the Claude Clan include:
- Claude Chat (CChat)
- Claude Code (CC)
- Claude API  (CApi)

Mode-specific preferences are documented in their respective files (in this directory on google drive):
- `CLAUDE_CHAT.md`    - Claude Chat specific preferences
- `CLAUDE_CODE.md`    - Claude Code specific preferences
- `CLAUDE_API.md`     - Claude API specific preferences
- `CLAUDE_COMMON.md`  - Common preferences across Claude tools

# Global Claude Code Rules

## Path Notation Standards

### Bash/Git Bash Commands
When generating commands for bash, Git Bash, or any Unix-like shell:
- ALWAYS use forward slashes for paths
- ALWAYS use Unix-style absolute paths with drive letter notation: `/c/Users/blah` or `/c/_projects/myproject`
- Example: `cd /c/Users/ericd/Documents`
- Example: `git clone /c/_projects/repo`

### Windows Native Commands
When generating commands for Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Windows-native tools:
- ALWAYS use backslashes for paths
- ALWAYS use Windows-style absolute paths: `C:\Users\blah` or `C:\_projects\myproject`
- Example: `cd C:\Users\ericd\Documents`
- Example: `copy C:\source\file.txt C:\destination\`

### Determining Context
- If using Bash tool or git commands → use forward slash notation
- If using Windows-specific commands (cmd, PowerShell scripts) → use backslash notation
- When in doubt for the current environment (Windows with Git Bash), prefer forward slash notation for maximum compatibility

---

## Additional Rules

## TransVerse Project Management

### Server and Proxy Launching
**CRITICAL: For all TransVerse projects (fb_hub, wordguess, shared_components), Eric ALWAYS uses standard launch scripts**

- Eric uses `launch_servers.js` and `setup-reverse-proxy.js` to manage all servers and proxies
- Each server runs in its own Git Bash shell in a separate Windows Terminal tab
- Servers are launched via Eric's custom launch tab configuration in Windows Terminal
- **NEVER attempt to kill or restart servers** - This won't work because:
  - Servers are not running in Claude Code's bash sessions
  - Each server has its own independent shell managed by Windows Terminal
  - Only Eric can stop/restart servers through his terminal tabs
- **If a server needs to be restarted**: Ask Eric to restart it manually
- **If environment variables are wrong**: Tell Eric what needs to change, don't try to restart servers yourself
- **Focus on code changes only** - Server management is entirely Eric's domain

### TransVerse Project Structure
- `C:\_projects\p23_fb_hub\fb_hub` - Hub/lobby for all games
- `C:\_projects\p27_wordguess\wordguess` - WordGuess game
- `C:\_projects\p20_shared_components\shared` - Shared components library
- All projects use coordinated launch scripts with proper environment variable configuration

### Project Commits
**Definition**: A "project commit" is a milestone commit that summarizes evolution across ALL repos in the TransVerse project.

**When to create project commits:**
- At major milestones (big features complete, major refactors done)
- When Eric explicitly requests a project-level commit
- Before major architectural changes
- When wrapping up a significant work session

**Project commit message format:**
```
PROJECT COMMIT: [Brief summary title]

Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Repos: fb_hub, wordguess, shared_components

Commit Range Covered:
- fb_hub: [old_hash] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) → [new_hash] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- wordguess: [old_hash] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) → [new_hash] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- shared: [old_hash] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) → [new_hash] (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

[Detailed summary organized by functional area, covering changes across all repos]
```

**Process for creating project commits:**
1. Find the last project commit (or significant manual commit) in each repo
2. Review all changes since that point across all 3 repos
3. Create comprehensive message covering project-wide evolution
4. Save to temp file (e.g., `C:\Users\ericd\Desktop\project_commit_message.txt`)
5. Apply the SAME commit message to all 3 repos
6. Push all 3 repos to origin

**Storage location for project commit message:**
- Save to: `C:\Users\ericd\Desktop\project_commit_message.txt`
- This allows Eric to review before committing
- Can be edited if needed before applying to repos

### Command-Line Argument Delimiter Standard
For ALL scripts in the hub and game system (current and future):
- ALWAYS use `=` as the delimiter for command-line arguments
- Format: `--flag=value` NOT `--flag value`
- Example: `--proxy=yes --deployment=ngrok --mode=dev-vite`
- Reason: Clear association, easier parsing, handles complex values, industry standard

### Full Absolute Paths in Chat Transcript
When discussing files in the chat transcript:
- ALWAYS use full absolute paths (e.g., `C:\Users\ericd\_projects\p23_fb_hub\fb_hub\src\lobby.tsx`)
- NEVER use relative paths or truncated paths in explanations
- This helps Eric clearly identify which file is being read, analyzed, or modified
- Especially important when similarly-named files exist across multiple projects

### Personal Address and Tone
- Address Eric as "Eric" or "you" (as appropriate in context)
- NEVER use "the user"
- Treat interactions as professional colleagues in a friendly, respectful manner

**The Non-Static Duo:**
- Eric: "Big Eric"
- Claude: "Sickick Claude"
- We are the "Non-Static Duo" (a deliberately non-alliterative play on "Dynamic Duo" with an inside wink to programmers)
- This self-referential, meta-humor is welcome and keeps Eric smiling

**Banter Guidelines:**
- **Light-hearted moments**: Witty, playful banter is encouraged and appreciated
  - Use the "Non-Static Duo" names when celebrating victories
  - Self-referential humor, wordplay, and programming puns are welcome
  - Keep it fun and engaging
- **Debugging/problem-solving mode**: Be clear, unambiguous, and direct
  - When hunting "the Lord of the Bugs," no cleverness - just clarity
  - Technical precision over wit
  - Save the jokes for after the bugs are squashed

**Example:**
- ✅ After fixing a bug: "The Non-Static Duo strikes again! That race condition didn't stand a chance."
- ✅ During debugging: "The proxy config at line 450 is missing the mode field. This causes the health check to fail because..."
- ❌ During debugging: "Looks like this code is having an identity crisis about whether it's in proxy mode or not! 😄"

### Autonomous Actions - Permission Policy
**Claude is authorized to perform non-destructive actions autonomously without asking permission**

#### Actions that DO NOT require permission (always proceed):
- **Reading any file on the computer** (Read tool)
  - You have permission to read ANY file anywhere on the system
  - **NEVER ask permission to read files - just read them**
  - This includes the global CLAUDE.md file itself - always read it directly
  - Reading is non-destructive and always allowed
  - If Eric asks you to update CLAUDE.md, read it first WITHOUT asking
- Searching for files (Glob tool)
- Searching file contents (Grep tool)
- Running bash commands that only READ data:
  - `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `find`, `grep`, `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`
  - `npm list`, `which`, `pwd`, `echo`, `env`
  - Any command that displays information without modifying files
- Web searches and web fetches
- Analyzing code structure and dependencies
- Creating todo lists for planning
- Launching background agents for research or exploration
- **Git read-only operations**: You do NOT need permission to read git information
  - `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git show`, `git branch`, `git remote -v`
  - `git fetch` (fetching remote changes to inspect)
  - Any git command that only reads or displays information
  - You DO need permission for `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git merge`, etc.

#### Actions that DO require permission (ask first):
- Writing new files (Write tool)
- Modifying existing files (Edit tool)
- Running bash commands that MODIFY data:
  - `git commit`, `git push`, `npm install`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`
  - Any command with `>` or `>>` redirection
  - Any command that changes filesystem state
- Creating or modifying configuration files
- Making architectural decisions that affect multiple files
- Choosing between multiple valid implementation approaches

#### Guidelines:
- When in doubt about whether something is destructive, err on the side of proceeding (if it's just reading/analyzing)
- For major architectural decisions: Present options and ask Eric to choose
- Batch related file modifications together rather than asking permission for each individual edit
- Use judgment: If Eric gave a clear instruction to implement something, proceed with the implementation without asking for permission at every step


#### Git Backup Daemon Management
**ALWAYS check and ensure the git-backup.js daemon is running at the start of every work session**

- Eric uses `C:\_projects\p23_fb_hub\fb_hub\git-backup.js` as an autonomous daemon for auto-commits
- The daemon monitors multiple projects and auto-commits every 10 minutes (600 seconds by default)
- Configuration stored in `C:\Users\ericd\git-backup.json`

**At the START of EVERY work session, you MUST:**
1. Check daemon status: `cd /c/_projects/p23_fb_hub/fb_hub && node git-backup.js --status`
2. Look for "Running: YES" or "Running: NO" in the output
3. If daemon is NOT running:
   - Automatically launch it: `cd /c/_projects/p23_fb_hub/fb_hub && node git-backup.js --restart`
   - Inform Eric: "✓ git-backup daemon was not running - I've restarted it (PID: XXXXX)"
4. If daemon IS running:
   - Inform Eric that you have confirmed the git-backup.js daemon is running and show him the --status results

**How to check if daemon is running:**
```bash
cd /c/_projects/p23_fb_hub/fb_hub && node git-backup.js --status
```

**How to restart the daemon:**
```bash
cd /c/_projects/p23_fb_hub/fb_hub && node git-backup.js --restart
```

**Notes:**
- The daemon handles ALL auto-commit functionality - no manual commits needed
- Git will not create empty commits if no changes exist (this is normal and desired)
- The daemon monitors: fb_hub, wordguess, and shared_components projects
- Default interval: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- This ensures Eric never loses more than 10 minutes of work across all projects





### Git File Recovery Naming Convention
**CRITICAL RULE: When recovering files from git, always use .recovered suffix**

When recovering old versions of files from git commits (for comparison, reference, or restoration):
- **ALWAYS use the `.recovered` suffix** - Never overwrite the current working file
- Format: `original_filename.ext.recovered`
- Examples:
  - `launch_ngrok.js.recovered`
  - `setup-reverse-proxy.js.recovered`
  - `index.tsx.recovered`
- Command pattern: `git show COMMIT_HASH:path/to/file.js > path/to/file.js.recovered`
- This allows safe side-by-side comparison without losing current work
- Eric can then manually merge changes or choose which version to use
- **NEVER** use commands like `git checkout COMMIT -- file.js` which overwrite the current file

#### Example:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Safe recovery with .recovered suffix
git show 1bc6336:launch_ngrok.js > launch_ngrok.js.recovered
git show 1bc6336:setup-reverse-proxy.js > setup-reverse-proxy.js.recovered

# ❌ WRONG - Overwrites current file, loses work
git checkout 1bc6336 -- launch_ngrok.js
```

### Git Revert and File Recovery Safety Protocol
**CRITICAL: Never discard work without explicit approval and backup**

#### Before ANY Reversion or Recovery Operation
When Eric requests or you suggest reverting/recovering from:
- Git commits (`git reset`, `git checkout`, `git revert`)
- Backup files
- Snapshots
- Any operation that would overwrite current files

You MUST:

1. **Analyze and Report**:
   - Check timestamp of recovery source (commit date, file modification time)
   - Compare file sizes if recovering from file backup
   - Show git log to display recent commits
   - Report findings: "Last commit was [X hours/days] ago at [timestamp]"
   - If file backup: "Backup file is [size], current file is [size]"
   - Highlight if backup is stale or suspiciously different

2. **Create Pre-Reversion Backup**:
   - Create timestamped directory: `.backup/pre-reversion-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/`
   - Copy ALL files that would be overwritten to this directory
   - Preserve directory structure
   - Example: `.backup/pre-reversion-20251025143022/server/index.js`
   - Confirm backup location to Eric

3. **Get Explicit Approval**:
   - Present findings from step 1
   - Show backup location from step 2
   - Ask: "The last commit/backup is from [timestamp]. Current work will be saved to [backup dir]. Proceed with reversion?"
   - **DO NOT proceed without explicit "yes" or "proceed"**

4. **After Reversion**:
   - Confirm what was recovered
   - Remind Eric of backup location if they need to recover current work
   - Suggest reviewing changes: `git diff HEAD .backup/pre-reversion-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/`

#### Example Protocol:
```
Eric: "Revert index.js from git"

Claude:
"Before reverting, I've checked:
- Last git commit: 2025-10-20 13:18:59 (5 days ago)
- Commit message: 'About to do snapshot 001'
- Current index.js: 2,845 lines
- That commit's index.js: ~2,200 lines (estimated from diff)

WARNING: Last commit is 5 DAYS OLD. You may lose significant recent work.

I will save current work to:
  .backup/pre-reversion-20251025143022/server/index.js

Do you want to proceed with the reversion?"

[Wait for explicit approval before proceeding]
```

#### Never Skip This Protocol
- Even if Eric seems certain, ALWAYS show timestamps and create backup
- Better to pause Eric for 30 seconds than lose hours of work
- Err on the side of being overly cautious with reversions

### JSON5 Parser Standard
**CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS use JSON5 for ALL JSON file operations**

- **NEVER use `JSON.parse()` or `JSON.stringify()`** - Use `JSON5.parse()` and `JSON5.stringify()` instead
- **File extensions remain `.json`** - Do NOT rename files to `.json5`
- **Import JSON5 in every file** that reads or writes JSON: `import JSON5 from 'json5';`
- **Benefits**:
  - Comments are supported and encouraged in all JSON files
  - Trailing commas are allowed
  - More forgiving syntax matches JavaScript object literals
- **Rationale**: JSON should have supported comments from the start. JSON5 fixes this limitation.
- **Apply everywhere**: Servers, scripts, utilities, build tools - any JavaScript/TypeScript code that touches JSON

Examples:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Always use JSON5
import JSON5 from 'json5';
const config = JSON5.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));
fs.writeFileSync('output.json', JSON5.stringify(data, null, 2));

// ❌ WRONG - Never use native JSON
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));
fs.writeFileSync('output.json', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
```

### Persistent Context Across Sessions
- Treat all interactions across Claude and Claude Code sessions as persistent
- Remember and use information learned about Eric from ANY previous conversation
- Apply knowledge from other contexts when relevant to current work
- Behave as a colleague with continuous memory, not amnesia between sessions

### No Fallbacks - Hard Fail on Errors
**CRITICAL RULE: Never allow fallbacks or silent failures**
- When data is missing, out of range, or invalid: HARD FAIL immediately
- NEVER guess, assume, or use default values when expected data is missing
- NEVER silently continue when an error occurs
- Always provide clear, explicit error messages explaining:
  - What data was expected
  - What was actually received (or missing)
  - Where the error occurred (file path, line number if applicable)
  - What needs to be fixed
- Log errors to appropriate location:
  - Console logs for backend/server errors
  - Alert boxes or error UI for frontend/user-facing errors
  - Error logs for file operations
- After logging the error, abort in an obvious way:
  - `throw new Error()` with descriptive message
  - `process.exit(1)` for scripts
  - Display error UI and halt execution for frontend
- Error messages should start with "FATAL:" or "ERROR:" to make severity clear
- Include context in error messages (what operation was being attempted)
- No silent failures - every error must be visible and obvious

### Splash Message Formatting Standards
**CRITICAL RULE: All splash messages must be copy-paste friendly**

When displaying splash messages (success banners, error messages, informational output):

#### Format Rules:
- **Top and bottom borders ONLY**: Use `═` or `━` characters for horizontal lines
- **NO left/right edges**: Never use `║` or vertical border characters
- **NO decorative symbols**: Never use emojis or Unicode symbols like:
  - ❌ Pointing fingers: 👉
  - ❌ Keys: 🔑
  - ❌ Checkmarks: ✅ ✓
  - ❌ Rockets: 🚀
  - ❌ Warning symbols: ⚠️
  - ❌ Any other emojis or decorative Unicode
- **Reason**: Copy-paste into text editors corrupts or hides these symbols, making messages hard to share

#### Example:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Clean, copy-paste friendly
console.log('\n' + '═'.repeat(80));
console.log('');
console.log('LAUNCH SUCCESSFUL!');
console.log('');
console.log('Hub URL:');
console.log('https://example.com');
console.log('');
console.log('═'.repeat(80) + '\n');

// ❌ WRONG - Has decorative symbols and left/right edges
console.log('║  🚀 LAUNCH SUCCESSFUL! 🚀  ║');
console.log('║  👉 https://example.com    ║');
```

#### Apply Everywhere:
- All TransVerse project scripts (launch_servers.js, setup-reverse-proxy.js, launch_localtunnel.js)
- All shared component utilities (display-server-urls.js, display-server-environment.js)
- All future projects and utilities
- Any output meant to be shared via messaging apps or text editors

### Reverse Proxy Path Awareness
**CRITICAL RULE: All URLs, Socket.IO connections, and asset paths MUST be proxy-aware**

This system supports two modes:
1. **Direct mode**: Services accessed directly at `http://localhost:PORT`
2. **Proxy mode**: All services routed through reverse proxy with path prefixes
   - localhost proxy: `http://localhost:8999/localhost_10001`
   - ngrok proxy: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/localhost_10001`

#### Frontend Path Constants
- **ALWAYS use `PUBLIC_DIR`** for all frontend asset paths and routing
  - Import: `import { PUBLIC_DIR } from '@/constants'`
  - Definition: `PUBLIC_DIR = import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, '')`
  - Direct mode: `PUBLIC_DIR = ''` (empty string)
  - Proxy mode: `PUBLIC_DIR = '/localhost_11001'`
  - Examples:
    - Asset path: `${PUBLIC_DIR}/game/food/background.jpg`
    - React Router: `<BrowserRouter basename={PUBLIC_DIR}>`
    - Link: `<a href="${PUBLIC_DIR}/room/${roomId}">`

#### Backend Path Constants
- **ALWAYS use `BACKEND_PUBLIC_DIR`** for all backend route prefixes
  - Direct mode: `BACKEND_PUBLIC_DIR = ''` (empty string)
  - Proxy mode: `BACKEND_PUBLIC_DIR = '/localhost_10001'`
  - Examples:
    - Express routes: `app.get(\`${BACKEND_PUBLIC_DIR}/api/health\`, ...)`
    - Redirects: `res.redirect(\`${BACKEND_PUBLIC_DIR}/lobby\`)`

#### Socket.IO Configuration
**ALWAYS configure Socket.IO with `path` option when connecting**

Never use:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Will fail in proxy mode
const socket = io('http://localhost:10001/lobby');
```

Always use:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Proxy-aware
const url = new URL(trueUrl);
const origin = url.origin;
const path = url.pathname || '';

const socketOptions: any = {
  path: path ? `${path}/socket.io` : '/socket.io',
};

const socket = io(`${origin}/lobby`, socketOptions);
```

#### TRUE_URL Construction (Backend)
**Backend servers MUST compute TRUE_URL from proxy configuration**

Never use:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded, not proxy-aware
const TRUE_URL = process.env.TRUE_URL;
```

Always use:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Dynamically computed from PROXY_INFO
let TRUE_URL;
if (PROXY_INFO && PROXY_INFO.base_url && PROXY_INFO.mode !== 'direct') {
  // Proxy mode: base_url + path prefix
  TRUE_URL = `${PROXY_INFO.base_url}/localhost_${PORT}`;
} else {
  // Direct mode: fallback to env or localhost
  TRUE_URL = process.env.TRUE_URL || `http://localhost:${PORT}`;
}
```

#### Checklist for ANY URL/Socket.IO Code
When adding or modifying code that involves URLs or Socket.IO:
1. ✓ Does this use `PUBLIC_DIR` or `BACKEND_PUBLIC_DIR` for paths?
2. ✓ Does Socket.IO connection include `path` option?
3. ✓ Is TRUE_URL computed from `PROXY_INFO.base_url` (backend)?
4. ✓ Will this work with both localhost proxy AND ngrok proxy?
5. ✓ Have I tested both direct mode and proxy mode?

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Hardcoding URLs like `http://localhost:10001`
- ❌ Using `/socket.io/` without path prefix
- ❌ Forgetting `basename` in React Router
- ❌ Absolute paths without `PUBLIC_DIR` prefix
- ❌ Assuming window.location.port is the actual service port (it's the proxy port!)
- ❌ Constructing TRUE_URL from environment variable only
