## Health Conditions / Notes

### Diagnosed Conditions

#### 1. Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea
- **Diagnosed:** 2024 (sleep study with wires in lab)
- **Severity:** SEVERE - waking up average **36 times per hour** (extreme upper range)
- **Treatment:** CPAP machine prescribed
  - **Equipment:** Top-of-line CPAP unit (~$1500 retail, paid few hundred with Ontario subsidy)
  - **Received:** 3 weeks ago (mid-October 2025)
  - **Usage history:** Used 1 week initially (slept fine), stopped for 2 weeks during coding work
  - **Mask type:** Full face (covers nose and mouth) - Eric is mouth breather
  - **Bringing on 6-month trip:** YES
  - **Commitment:** Use every night starting NOW (except when impractical like bus travel)
- **Impact:** Chronic exhaustion, 36 brain wake-ups per hour trying to breathe
- **Note:** Eric barely breathes through nose (possibly deviated septum, never checked). With cold/sniffles, zero nasal airflow.

#### 2. Atrial Fibrillation (A-Fib)
- **Discovered:** During sleep apnea testing, confirmed by doctor and Ottawa Heart Institute
- **Severity:** Virtually **24/7** A-fib (at least 23 hours per day) - NOT intermittent like most patients
- **Testing completed:**
  - ECG by family doctor (confirmed)
  - 4-day portable halter monitor from Ottawa Heart Institute (confirmed 24/7 A-fib)
  - Heart ultrasound at Ottawa Heart Institute (ejection fraction checked, nothing bad reported)
- **Current treatment:**
  - Apixaban 5mg × 2/day (blood thinner to prevent stroke)
  - NEW heart rate medication starting Nov 3 (6-month supply from Costco)
- **Heart rate issues:**
  - **Resting:** 95 BPM (normal is 60-90)
  - **With modest exercise:** Spikes to **260 BPM** (DANGEROUSLY HIGH - normal max is ~150-180)
  - **Risk:** Excessively fast heart rate is dangerous during physical exertion
- **Future treatment options (next summer 2026):**
  - **Option A:** Cardioversion (electrical "zap" to reset heart rhythm)
    - 70% success rate per treatment
    - No meaningful side effects
    - Temporary - A-fib may return (day/month/year/years)
    - Can repeat multiple times
  - **Option B:** Catheter ablation (PREFERRED)
    - Catheter from groin → heart via blood vessel
    - Ablate (scar) heart muscle in key spots to isolate neural short circuit
    - Highly reliable, essentially permanent repair
    - Day procedure, not particularly dangerous
  - **Decision:** Eric will choose path next summer 2026

#### 3. Depression and Hypo-Mania
- **Managed with:** Divalproex (stabilizer) + Escitalopram (SSRI)
- **History:** Multiple depression episodes throughout life
- **Worst episode:** Summer 2024 (see Health Crisis section below)

#### 4. High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)
- **Managed with:** Amlodipine, Atorvastatin, Candesartan

#### 5. High Cholesterol
- **Managed with:** Atorvastatin (Lipitor)

#### 6. Low Testosterone
- **Testing:** Barely within lower end of normal range
- **Doctor:** Would not prescribe testosterone booster treatment
- **Self-treatment:** Costco "Testosterone Red" supplement (claims to help body use existing testosterone more efficiently)
- **Results:** No noticeable change

### Health Crisis - Summer 2024

**Timeline of Events:**

**Early 2024 - Vietnam Trip:**
- Final days in Hanoi: Contracted severe chest infection + food poisoning
- Symptoms: Chest infection lingered 6 months, worst diarrhea lasting days
- **Weight loss:** 30 pounds lost in 5 months after returning home
- Clothes falling off, severely weakened

**May - October 2024 - Severe Depression:**
- **Mom died**
- **Serious CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) trouble:** Threatened with financial ruin, potential poverty
- **Lost 80% of retirement savings:** Chinese scammer organization, bad business investment made while already financially desperate from CRA situation
- **Mental state:** Worst depression ever experienced
- **Physical state:** Could not leave cottage for **6 weeks straight**
- **Activity level:** Completely immobilized - no projects, no coding, no renovations
- **Behavior:** Watched YouTube all day, exhausted and anxious when attempting to go outside
- **Duration:** Immobilization lasted May - October 2024

**Weight Fluctuation History (Dramatic):**
- **Early 2024:** Lost 30 lbs in 5 months (Vietnam illness)
- **Return to work:** Gained 30 lbs in 3 months
- **Diet phase:** Lost 30 lbs in 4 months (strict 2100 cal/day, 12-hr fasts daily, 24-hr fasts 2×/week)
- **Fired in May 2024:** Returned to cottage, gained 30-40 lbs in 5-6 months (May-Oct 2024)
- **Current:** Still gaining weight easily, exhausted constantly

**Contributing factors to summer 2024 crisis:**
- Physical: Undiagnosed severe sleep apnea (36 wake-ups/hour) causing chronic exhaustion
- Physical: Undiagnosed A-fib with dangerous heart rate spikes
- Physical: Lingering 6-month chest infection from Vietnam
- Mental: Post-travel depression
- Mental: Mom's death
- Financial: CRA threatening bankruptcy
- Financial: Lost 80% retirement savings to scammers

**Current status (Nov 2025):**
- Sleep apnea diagnosed, CPAP prescribed (needs consistent use)
- A-fib diagnosed, medicated (Apixaban + heart rate med starting Nov 3)
- Depression managed with meds (Divalproex + Escitalopram)
- Financially stressed but dealing "positively and constructively"
- Planning 6-month trip as positive step forward

---

### Current Symptoms to Track

**Physical:**
- **Chronic exhaustion:** Constant, related to untreated sleep apnea (36 wake-ups/hour)
- **Wheezing:** Frequent, especially after exertion
- **Heart rate spikes:** Up to 260 BPM with modest exercise (DANGEROUS)
- **Weight gain:** Extremely easy to gain weight, difficult to lose
- **Huffing and puffing:** After stairs or physical work (Nov 2, 2025 - after waterfront work)
- **Light-headedness:** When sleep-deprived (Nov 2, 2025 - minimal sleep since 3:30 AM)

**Management:**
- Rest, eat (yogurt), take regular medications
- Monitor heart rate during physical activities
- Use CPAP every night (prevents 36 wake-ups/hour)
- Avoid overexertion with A-fib/high heart rate

### CRITICAL Medical Notes for 6-Month Trip

**⚠️ LIFE-THREATENING RISKS:**
- **Apixaban (blood thinner):** Increases bleeding risk - be VERY careful with injuries during travel
- **Severe sleep apnea:** MUST use CPAP every night (bringing machine on trip)
- **A-fib + heart rate spikes:** Monitor exertion, heart can hit 260 BPM (dangerous)
- **Depression management:** CANNOT skip medications - risk of immobilizing depression like summer 2024
- **Stroke risk:** A-fib + missing Apixaban = permanent brain damage from stroke

**Non-Negotiable Daily Requirements:**
1. Morning medications (7 pills + 6 supplements)
2. 9 PM Apixaban (blood thinner)
3. CPAP machine every night (except when impractical)

**CC Authorization:** Claude Code is AUTHORIZED and REQUIRED to enforce medication compliance and CPAP usage. Will refuse to code or assist until Eric confirms compliance.
