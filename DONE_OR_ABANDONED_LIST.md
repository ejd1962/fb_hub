### ✅ Vehicles - Jeep Cherokee (THE EPIC AIR LOCK BATTLE)

- [x] **Jeep antifreeze - AIR LOCK BATTLE**
  - **Completed:** November 2, 11:51 PM - **VICTORY!**
  - **Battle duration:** 8:10 PM - 11:51 PM (3h 41min of troubleshooting)

  **Timeline:**
  - **Fill #1** (1:37 PM): 1.9L premixed 50/50 → Some heat, but air lock remained
  - **Failed Attempt #1** (8:10-8:40 PM): Highway driving at 110 km/h → Cold air blast prevented heating
  - **Failed Attempt #2** (9:35-10:50 PM): 75 min idle at 800 RPM → Plateaued at 47% gauge
  - **Failed Attempt #3** (10:56-11:03 PM): 2500 RPM sustained → Still air locked
  - **BREAKTHROUGH** (11:03-11:51 PM): **4000 RPM burst for 1 minute → AIR LOCK BROKE!**

  **Fills after breakthrough:**
  - **Fill #2:** 2.0L PURE concentrated antifreeze
  - **Fill #3:** 1.0L premixed 50/50
  - **TOTAL ADDED: 4.9L**

  **The RIBBET moment:**
  - Heater still blowing cold → panic!
  - Noticed temp set to 28°C (not MAX)
  - Changed to MAX → **IMMEDIATELY BLOWING HOT AIR!**

  **Final protection achieved:**
  - Pure antifreeze: 3.45L out of 4.9L total = **70.4% concentration**
  - **Freeze protection: -55°C** (goal was -37°C)
  - **CRUSHED THE GOAL** - engine block safe all winter

  **Key lessons:**
  - Highway driving counterproductive (cold air blast at 2°C ambient)
  - Idle insufficient (heat loss equals heat generation)
  - 2500 RPM not enough (still plateaued)
  - **4000 RPM burst = magic number to break severe air lock**
  - MAX heater setting bypasses A/C logic for instant heat

  **Impact:** **Non-Static Duo defeats the Automotive Lord of the Locks!** Engine protected, winter-ready.
