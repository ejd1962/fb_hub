# Eric's Pre-Departure Triage and Task Tracking
========================================================================

**Created:** 2025-11-02 03:30 AM (Saturday)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02 7:40 PM (Saturday) by Eric + CC
**Purpose:** Master triage list for all tasks between NOW and O-time (and beyond)
**Maintained by:** Claude Code (CC) with Eric's input

---

## 📱 How Eric Updates This File (The @@@ System)

**Eric's mobile workflow:**
- Eric can view and edit this file on his phone via Google Drive at `/My Drive/CLAUDE_RULES/TO_DO_LIST.md`
- When Eric completes a task or makes progress, he adds update lines starting with `@@@` (3 AT symbols)
- Example: `@@@ 10:30 AM - Found the registration! Kitchen table now organized and boxed.`
- CC (Claude Code) periodically reads the Google Drive version, finds all `@@@` lines, and syncs the updates back to the fb_hub repository
- CC converts `@@@` progress notes into proper task status updates with timestamps and checkmarks
- This allows Eric to update from anywhere (phone, laptop, tablet) and CC keeps everything synced

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Eric can update on the go without needing to use git or the laptop
- ✅ Progress is captured in real-time as tasks are completed
- ✅ CC handles the cleanup/formatting and keeps both versions in sync
- ✅ The `@@@` marker makes it easy for CC to find new updates with a simple grep
- ✅ Survives power outages and laptop crashes (Google Drive is the source of truth)

### Vehicles - Ford Escape & Jeep

- [x] **Repair Ford Escape rear window (broken hinges, 1" gap)** ✅ DONE
  - **Deadline:** O-time (Sunday 3 PM) - MUST fix before driving to Ottawa
  - **Time:** 30-45 minutes (faster than expected!)
  - **Why CRITICAL:** Rain entering car over 6 months = interior damage, mold, electronics
  - **Final approach:** Gorilla Duct Tape instead of black goo adhesive
    1. ✅ Removed 2 pneumatic cylinders (carefully supported window)
    2. ✅ Positioned window properly
    3. ✅ Gorilla Tape around all 4 sides from outside
  - **Result:** **3:50 PM - COMPLETED using Gorilla Duct Tape. Looks great, better than new! Waterproof, super strong. May never use black goo (found but decided tape faster/cleaner). Good for 2 trips (to Stittsville + May return). Proper repair deferred to spring 2026 if needed.**

- [x] **Jeep antifreeze - AIR LOCK BATTLE** ✅ VICTORY AT 11:51 PM!
  - **Vehicle:** 2016 Jeep Cherokee (sealed system, fills through overflow tank only)
  - **Why CRITICAL:** Current fluid ~99% water, will freeze solid and crack radiator + engine block = $$$$ damage
  - **System capacity:** ~10L total
  - **Materials:** ✓ 3 bottles antifreeze (2 premixed 50/50, 1 pure concentrated)
  - **Battle duration:** 8:10 PM - 11:51 PM (3h 41min of troubleshooting)

  **THE BATTLE TIMELINE:**

  **Fill #1** (1:37 PM): 1.9L premixed 50/50 → Some heat, but air lock remained

  **Failed Attempt #1 - Highway driving** (8:10-8:40 PM):
  - 110 km/h for 30+ min → Cold air blast prevented heating
  - Result: Stone cold heater, 37.5% temp gauge, radiator ice cold
  - Diagnosis: SEVERE AIR LOCK

  **Failed Attempt #2 - Idle test** (9:35-10:50 PM):
  - 75 min at 800 RPM idle, hood closed
  - Slowly climbed 37.5% → 47% (plateau at 2°C ambient)
  - Not enough heat generation to break air lock

  **Failed Attempt #3 - 2500 RPM sustained** (10:56-11:03 PM):
  - Brick on gas pedal, steady 2500 RPM
  - Still 47% gauge, still stone cold air
  - Air lock holding strong

  **BREAKTHROUGH - 4000 RPM BURST** (11:03-11:51 PM):
  - Increased RPM to 4000 for 1 minute → **AIR LOCK BROKE!**
  - Shut down, cracked cap → **MASSIVE BUBBLING/BOILING**
  - Overflow tank emptied in 2 minutes
  - **Fill #2:** Added 2.0L PURE concentrated antifreeze
  - Ran at idle, shut down, cracked cap → More bubbling
  - **Fill #3:** Added 1.0L premixed 50/50
  - **TOTAL ADDED: 4.9L (1.9L + 2.0L + 1.0L)**

  **THE RIBBET MOMENT:**
  - Heater still blowing cold → panic!
  - Noticed temp set to 28°C (not MAX)
  - Changed to MAX → **IMMEDIATELY BLOWING HOT AIR!**
  - Lesson: MAX bypasses A/C logic, gives instant heat

  **FINAL PROTECTION ACHIEVED:**
  - Pure antifreeze added: 3.45L out of 4.9L total = **70.4% concentration**
  - **Freeze protection: -55°C** (goal was -37°C for 50/50 mix)
  - **CRUSHED THE GOAL** - engine block safe all winter
  - Spring 2026: Use hydrometer to measure and adjust to optimal 50/50

  **Key lessons learned:**
  - Highway driving counterproductive (cold air blast)
  - Idle insufficient (2°C ambient = heat loss)
  - 2500 RPM not enough (heat plateau)
  - **4000 RPM burst = magic number to break severe air lock**
  - MAX heater setting = instant hot air (bypasses A/C logic)

  **Status:** ✅ **11:51 PM - COMPLETE VICTORY! Non-Static Duo defeats the Automotive Lord of the Locks!**

- [ ] **Develop bash command categorizer for autonomous CC operation**
  - **Deadline:** Once settled in Europe (remote, post-trip priority)

    - Each category has permission rule (some = "just do it")
    - Gives CC more autonomy, reduces interruptions for trivial decisions
  - **Examples of IDOs:**
    - `rm *.backup` - removing backup files

**This is TIGHT - very little buffer for unexpected issues.**

**Buffer for unexpected:** 2-4 hours recommended

**REMAINING TIME FOR YELLOW:** 0-2 hours (if RED goes smoothly)

### Yellow Task Priority (if any time available)

1. **Clear garage for Jeep (3-5 hours)** - Prevents $$$ repairs but takes most time
2. **Lean-to A plastic (1 hour)** - Protects electronics
3. **Clear HVAC work areas (1-2 hours)** - Professional courtesy Kevin
4. **Quick items (<20 min each):** Tree limbs, grass, hot tub, glass table, plywood, tires, pressure washer, chairs
5. **Lean-tos B & C (2 hours)** - Only if miracle occurs

**Realistic assessment:** Garage for Jeep is unlikely unless RED tasks go exceptionally fast. Focus on quick YELLOWs if time permits.
