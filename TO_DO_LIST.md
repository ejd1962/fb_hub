========================================================================

**Created:** 2025-11-02 03:30 AM (Saturday)
**Purpose:** Master triage list for all tasks between NOW and O-time (and beyond)
**Maintained by:** Claude Code (CC) with Eric's input

## Triage Categories

### ðŸ”´ RED - MUST DO BEFORE O-TIME
Tasks that CANNOT be delayed or done remotely. If these don't get done, there are serious consequences (cottage damage, can't access servers remotely, trip is blocked, etc.)

### ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW - SHOULD DO IF TIME PERMITS
Important tasks that would be beneficial to complete, but can be worked around or delayed if time runs short.

### ðŸŸ¢ GREEN - CAN DO REMOTELY AFTER O-TIME
Tasks that can be completed from anywhere with internet access (Portugal, Vietnam, etc.) via remote access to Furnace Server.
