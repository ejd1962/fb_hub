# Eric's Pre-Departure Triage and Task Tracking
========================================================================

**Created:** 2025-11-02 03:30 AM (Saturday)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02 12:30 PM (Saturday) by Eric + CC
**Purpose:** Master triage list for all tasks between NOW and O-time (and beyond)
**Maintained by:** Claude Code (CC) with Eric's input

---

## üì± How Eric Updates This File (The @@@ System)

**Eric's mobile workflow:**
- Eric can view and edit this file on his phone via Google Drive at `/My Drive/CLAUDE_RULES/TO_DO_LIST.md`
- When Eric completes a task or makes progress, he adds update lines starting with `@@@` (3 AT symbols)
- Example: `@@@ 10:30 AM - Found the registration! Kitchen table now organized and boxed.`
- CC (Claude Code) periodically reads the Google Drive version, finds all `@@@` lines, and syncs the updates back to the fb_hub repository
- CC converts `@@@` progress notes into proper task status updates with timestamps and checkmarks
- This allows Eric to update from anywhere (phone, laptop, tablet) and CC keeps everything synced

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Eric can update on the go without needing to use git or the laptop
- ‚úÖ Progress is captured in real-time as tasks are completed
- ‚úÖ CC handles the cleanup/formatting and keeps both versions in sync
- ‚úÖ The `@@@` marker makes it easy for CC to find new updates with a simple grep
- ‚úÖ Survives power outages and laptop crashes (Google Drive is the source of truth)
